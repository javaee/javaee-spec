# Java EE Platform Specification ![](assets/images/java-compatible-enterprise-edition.gif)

This is the project for the Java EE Platform specification.  The Java
EE Platform specification is the umbrella specification that defines
the Java EE platform.  The platform specification doesn't define the
Java EE APIs directly, but rather includes them by reference to other
Java specifications and defines how they all fit together in the
overall Java EE platform.  The platform specification also defines
other attributes of the platform such as security, deployment,
transactions, and interoperability.

## Java EE Community Survey

Results from the Java EE Community Survey are available
[here](download/Java_EE_Survey_Results_December_2016.pdf).
Thanks for telling us how to evolve Java EE for the next generation of
cloud and microservices applications!

## Java EE 8

Work is now underway on Java EE 8 under
[JSR 366](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=366).
The Spec Leads for Java EE 8 are 
Linda DeMichiel and Bill Shannon.
A full list of the Expert Group members can be found on the
[JSR 366 page](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=366).

At JavaOne 2016, we presented our
[proposed update to our Java EE 8 plans](download/JavaEE8Update.pdf).
We'll decide exactly what updates to make based on the results of our
[survey](http://glassfish.org/survey), the results of other community surveys,
feedback from licensees, customers, and developers, and
[discussions in the platform expert group](https://javaee.groups.io/g/javaee-spec/topics).

We also presented some of our thoughts for future Java EE releases in
[Enterprise Java for the Cloud](download/JavaEE9.pdf) and
[Portable Cloud Applications with Java EE](download/PortableAppFinal.pdf).

Before our first proposal for Java EE 8 in 2014, we conducted an
extensive Java EE 8 Community Survey.  You can read about the
questions we asked and see the results 
[here](download/JavaEE8_Community_Survey_Results.pdf).
A number of the potential features we described in the survey
received strong support by the community.  To get further input, we then also
asked community members to tell us how they would prioritize among
these.  The results from this last part of the survey are described
[here](https://blogs.oracle.com/ldemichiel/entry/results_from_the_java_ee).

If you have further feedback for us, please join the
[javaee group](https://javaee.groups.io/g/javaee)
and the [javaee-spec subgroup](https://javaee.groups.io/g/javaee-spec)
and post to
[javaee-spec@javaee.groups.io](mailto:javaee-spec@javaee.groups.io)
for further discussion.

## Java EE 7

[Java EE 7](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=342) was released
as [JSR 342](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=342)
on May 28, 2013.  The Spec Leads for Java EE 7 were
Linda DeMichiel and Bill Shannon.
You'll find a full list of the Expert Group members who
contributed to Java EE 7 on the
[JSR 342 page](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=342).

## Project Communication

You can track all the platform expert group communication by
subscribing to the javaee-spec mailing list.  To subscribe, or to
browse the archives, see the
[javaee-spec group](https://javaee.groups.io/g/javaee-spec) page.

You can find the drafts of proposals and other working
documents on the [Documents](Documents) page.

## Other Java EE Specifications

[This table](Specifications) contains links to the project pages for
other Java EE specifications.

## Compatibility Requirements

The rules we follow to ensure backwards compatibility when revising
Java EE specifications are described on the
[Compatibility Requirements](CompatibilityRequirements) page.


## JCP Processes

The use of JCP processes by the Java EE group at Oracle is described on the
[JCP Processes](JCPProcesses) page.

## Annotation Rules

Annotations are used heavily in the Java EE programming model.
It's important that all Java EE specifications define and use
annotations in a consistent way.
We've written up some [DRAFT rules on how annotations work](AnnotationRules).
